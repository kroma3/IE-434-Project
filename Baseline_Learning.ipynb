From that we then got a linear prediction and then calculated some metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R^2 by comparing with the actual data. Our MAE was 5.736 which is the mean absolute error, which for us 5.73 is really good, if we look at the RMSE its 174.675 which is really high meaning that there is a crazy amount of variance, this means that maybe the linear model is not a good predictorfor our actual data and works well for some of it. if we look at the r^2 we can see that its .813 which is also good."],"metadata":{"id":"yH0kdYB6333e"}}]}
